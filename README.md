- Welcome to my portfolio!  I'm a Full Stack Developer based out of Denver, CO.  I love
making sleek, cool UIs which usually utilize Google Material Design concepts and research, and I'm (only slightly) obsessed with color theory.
- Databases and data are my jam, and while I work with both mySQL and mongoDB, I tend to prefer mongoDB.  Node.js and I are best buds.

- In my free time I enjoy painting, gardening, reading, coding, and llamas.  My greatest dream is
to find a project that incorporates all my loves, but alas, I have yet to find a way 
to include llamas in my code.  One day, though.  One day.
 ** UPDATE: now with llamas. https://k8blanco.github.io/clickyclicky/ **
